# Run project using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE
This project is entirely created by IntelliJ IDEA.

To generate a new project, open IntelliJ and navigate to:
* File
* New Project
* Name you project

Additionally:
* Set the language to Java (default)
* Set the build system to IntelliJ (default). Later that will be changed.
* Make sure "Add simple code" checkbox is checked.

As a result a new project is opened and the folder strucure and things like the main class, the main method and a sample "Hello world" code are generated.

In this example we explore the console input and output operations.
